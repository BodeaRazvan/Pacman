Results of the algorithms based on a few different maps 
!The maps will test a few cases of the algorithms to see which one performs better 
The results are also dependent on the order of the movements the algorithm considers.  In this case, the move priority is left,

Map1: DifficultDFS (map with just walls)
DFS:  total cost: 454
      nodes expanded: 455
      
BFS:  total cost: 46
      nodes expanded: 454
      
Rand:  total cost: 3550
       nodes expanded: 3550
       obs: number of nodes expanded and total cost of the solution ar the same,   highly variable nr of total moves but on average a lot worse than the search algorithms
Astar:  total cost: 46
        nodes expanded: 454
        
Map2: DifficultBFS  
DFS   250,251
BFS   150,253
Rand  60932,60932
  Rand performs even worse when it has fewer options to go to (it has to consider a lot of 50/50 to get to the end)
  
Map3: newGrid
DFS:34,87
BFS:24,127
Rand:1084,1084
  

Global obs: BFS is optimal and will expand the most ammount of nodes in order to find the best solution (higher computation time but the solution is the best one)
            DFS will try to reduce the nr of expanded nodes and find a possible solution 
            Random is the only alg that gives different solutions for the same problem.
